To keep up with what is going on in development, and learn some lingo, I subscribed to some Podcasts in the iTunes store.
I subscribed to Software Engineering Daily, Learn to Code with Me, CodeNewbie, and Developer Tea.  These were all on the
top list for the tech category.  If anyone has any good ones that i am missing, please let me know!
