title: Created 2 Alexa Skills Today 
---
Today I had my first Alexa Skill approved! It was a trivia game about baseball history.  The skill would ask the person a baseball 
history question and then list off 4 answers.  The user then selected which answer they thought was correct.  The skill scores you on 
how many answers that you get correct.  

The second skill that I submitted was facts about the city of Las Vegas, my favorite place to visit!  I put in 25 or 30 facts,
when the user says "Alexa, launch Las Vegas Facts," she will give you a fact about Las Vegas.

It was very cool learning about Lambda during these projects.  From what I understand, this is a newer on demand type server, that 
only runs when called upon.  I look forward to learning more about this technology.  

Now I get to develop something that is a little less of a template!  I am excited to get started!
