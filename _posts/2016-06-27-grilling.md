title: My Design Project For Alexa
---
I created another skill on Alexa!  I have my echo in the kitchen of my home, so I am food on my mind, in terms of ways to use Alexa.  I love to grill, and I use a weber cookbook, that came with my grill to 
look up the correct way to grill whatever I am grilling.  I set up the skill to ask what I am grilling, it the skill with reply with the correct way to grill it, in terms of direct or indirect heat, 
the level of heat, and the time it will take.  I got it working originally, but with my mentor, we wanted to learn more about the Amazon Web Services suite, so I made a DynamoDB to house the information,
and then call the information from a storage.js file.  I had an issue with and if then statement never failing.  After putting in console.logs all over the place, I just realized that when the skill was 
given a value where there wasn't a slot, DynamoDB would just give {} in return, which would be undefined in my code.  After much trial and error, the problem was solved with Object.keys(recipe).length != 0.
It felt great to finally get a solution to my problem, and getting the skill shipped!
