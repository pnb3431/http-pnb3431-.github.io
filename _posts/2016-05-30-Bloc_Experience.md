title: My Experience with Bloc, week 3!
---
We are currenlty developing a website like reddit, called bloccit.  It is really interesting to see how these things work
from the inside.  We worked on setting up posts and comments, then setting them inside of topics.  We did this by nesting them.
Every checkpoint we get closer and closer to the real thing.  I have run into some problems with assignments, most of the time
being a Tyop, that I have to go back and find.  Usually, if I take a break and come back to it, I tend to find the problem rather 
quickly!
