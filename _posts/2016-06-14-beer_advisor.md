title: My Design Project For Alexa
---
After designing two skills for Alexa based on templates, I am designing my own skill.  This skill is going to suggest a type of beer to
pair with the food that you are preparing.  When you launch the skill, Alexa will ask you what food you are preparing.  The challenge will be to have all of the possibilities covered
that a person will say.  I am setting up a DynamoDB to handle all of these phrases.  This is also my first exposure to Alexa Designer, a web app to help develop Alexa Skills.  My challenge now is to 
code this thing!  Here I go!
